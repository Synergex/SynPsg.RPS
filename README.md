**Description:** SynPsg.Rps is a namespace containing a set of classes which represent and expose information about a Synergy/DE repository. The main reason for adding these classes to CodeExchange was for it to be an example of OO coding in Synergy Language, but you may also find the classes useful, as they give you an alternative to using the Repository API (DDLIB.ELB / xcall dd_). Internally these classes manipulate the DDLIB routines, and present you with a more natural interface to the Repository.<br />
**Platforms:** Windows; Unix; OpenVMS<br />
**Products:** Synergy DBL<br />
**Minimum Version:** 9.1.5b<br />
